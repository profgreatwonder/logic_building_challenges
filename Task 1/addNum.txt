Task 1
Take two numbers as an input and print the addition of those two numbers.

Variables:
1. We receive the first input from the user and assign it to a variable, firstNum
2. We receive the second input from the user and assign it to a variable, secondNum
3. We then add both variables together and assign it to another variable, addNum
4. Finally, we print this variable addNum


Function:
1. define a Function, plusNum()
2. In the function block, we repeat the steps 1 and 2
3. step 3 is returned rather than assigning the addition to a variable then alerting(JS) or printing(Python). We could also assign to a variable before returning
4. Finally, we alert or print the function plusNum()
