# Logic Building Challenges #
over the next few months, I will be walking through a series of code problems to help new developers build their logic in programming. Everyday, I will:
1. Present a challenge
2. Help them Understand it
3. Write the algorithm for the challenge 
4. Then I will proceed to write the code for the challenge (mostly variables and functions) in 3 programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.

### Tasks ###
Task One: Take two numbers as an input and print the addition of those two numbers. More details about the steps can be found in addNum.txt

Task Two: Take three numbers as an input and print the average of those three numbers. More details about the steps can be found in avNum.txt
