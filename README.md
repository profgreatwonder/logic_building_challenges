# Logic Building Challenges #
over the next few months, I will be walking through a series of code problems to build my logic in programming. Everyday, I will:
Take a challenge
Understand it
Write the algorithm for the challenge 
Then I will proceed to write the code for the challenge (mostly variables and functions) in 3 programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.

### Tasks ###
Task One: Take two numbers as an input and print the addition of those two numbers. More details about the steps can be found in addNum.txt
