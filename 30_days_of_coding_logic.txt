I will be walking through a series of code problems over the next few months to build my logic in programming. Everyday, I will:
1. Take a challenge,
2. Understand it,
3. Write the algorithm for the challenge 
4. Then I will proceed to write the code for the challenge (mostly variables and functions) in 3 programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.
