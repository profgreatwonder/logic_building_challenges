I will be walking through a series of code problems over the next few months to build my logic in programming. Everyday, I will:
Take a challenge,
Understand it,
Write the algorithm for the challenge 
Then I will proceed to write the code for the challenge (mostly variables and functions) in 3 programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and PHP.
